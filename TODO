High
- Performance: Use ofPixels for WritableField
- Performance: newElements vector?
- Asthetics: Hide mouse

Medium
- Simplify HyphaStatus: remove BeforeInside, AfterInside. No longer needed, right?
- Settings: lists instead of ranges
- Settings: use JSON instead of XML

Low
- Asthetics: Better fade to white (using 2 FBOs and blend instead of just adding white)

Abandoned:
- Algorithm: Long fade out only when long lifetime (no longer needed because now only Fields with enough food are chosen)
- Algorithm: Measure screen occupancy (no longer needed because blobs are no longer being constantly generated)
