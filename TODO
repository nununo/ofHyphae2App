High
- Performance: newElements vector pass by value ok?
- Algorithm: increase Field horizontal size instead of adding the extra complexity of the tolerance
- Slower fade out

Medium
- Settings: lists instead of ranges

Low
- Asthetics: Better fade to white (using 2 FBOs and blend instead of just adding white)

Abandoned:
- Algorithm: Long fade out only when long lifetime (no longer needed because now only Fields with enough food are chosen)
- Algorithm: Measure screen occupancy (no longer needed because blobs are no longer being constantly generated)
- Performance: Use ofPixels for WritableField (I don't think this would increase performance much)
- Settings: use JSON instead of XML (too late for this)
